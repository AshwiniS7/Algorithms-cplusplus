Algorithms in C++

This repository contains C++ code that I created to solve competitive programming problems (such as for the USA Computing Olympiad).
The algorithms implemented (and accordingly named in the cpp files) are:

Union-find to merge sets and query their group ID
Range-minimum-query using segment tree data structure

Dynamic programming algorithms: 
0/1 Knapsack problem
Coin change problem (least amount of coins to make a certain amount of money)
Longest common subsequence in two strings
Longest common substring in two strings
Longest increasing subsequence in an array of numbers
Kadane's algorithm for finding maximum sum subarray and maximum sum rectangle in a matrix (2D array)
Shortest path from top-left corner to bottom-right corner of a numerical matrix (2D array)

Graph Algorithms:
Kruskal algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree in a graph
Prim algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree in a graph
Floyd Warshall algorithm for finding all pairs shortest paths in a graph
Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path in a graph with positive edge weights
Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest path in a graph with negative edge weights

Fast operations on trees
Heavy-light decomposition (HLD) to optimize queries on sub-paths in a tree
Lowest common ancestor (LCA) using binary-lifting
Lowest common ancestor (LCA) using a range-minimum-query
